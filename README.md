Description:

This project is a simulation where there is a colony of ants that is searching for food. It isn't in the greatest shape but some tweaks will be made eventually. This project was made specifically for HighSeas. Have fun!

How to use:

First, install VSCode from the website at https://code.visualstudio.com/download

Then, make sure you have the folder with all of the files installed and in a spot where you can access it easily, this will be important later.

Next, in VSCode when you open it you should see this screen:

Click on "Open Folder" and select the files that you downloaded from this page earlier

Finally, if everything works right, you should be able to click the button in the top right that looks like a play button and the simulation should run.

IF THE SIMULATION ISN'T WORKING

I haven't tested it yet but this is a very likely possibility. If the simulation isn't working, you will have to install python, pip, and pygame. To install any of these, you first need to install homebrew from their website:

https://docs.brew.sh/Installation

Then you can use the command "brew install python" and your system will install the latest version of python. after that, you should have pip3 installed (it comes with python3)

To install pygame, use the command "pip3 install pygame" after installing python and making sure you have pip3.

Then you should be good to go and the simulation should work. If you have any issues, just ask!
